# Neural network convex relaxations

Project done with G. Sarr for the Compressed Sensing course.

We studied two papers:

1. Convex Relaxations of Convolutional Neural Nets (https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00035):

This paper deals with training neural nets using convex relaxation to find the weights assuring the global minimum of the loss

2. A Convex Relaxation Barrier to Tight Robustness Verification of Neural Networks (https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08722):

This paper deals with methods for verifying the robustness of a neural network using convex relaxarion
